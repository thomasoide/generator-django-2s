# Breaking down the files in this project

This will explain and breakdown what each file does for the Django project. There are two separate sections: One for files generated by running the generator itself and one for files generated by the :startapp subgenerator.

## Project Generator

When you run `yo django-2s` the resulting file structure should look something like this:

```bash
.
├── Pipfile
├── README.md
├── config
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── base.py
│   │   ├── local.py
│   │   └── prod.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
├── data
├── docs
│   ├── files.md
│   └── setup.md
├── makefile
├── manage.py
└── resources
```

- **Pipfile**: This file contains all the packages that you want installed into your environment. It will create a Pipfile.lock when you run `pipenv install`
- **makefile**: This file contains several commands to run from the command line that will be of use in the development process.
- **manage.py**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. This plays a big role if you're writing your own custom management commands. You shouldn't have to change this file much.
- **/data**: Any data in CSVs should go in this directory. If you want you can create subdirectories for each of your Django applications. If you do this, be sure to change your DATA_LOCATION setting to point in the right place.
- **/docs**: Where README.files live for your specific project.
- **/resources**: This is a directory that can be deleted if needed. It's a place to put miscellaneous files that are related to your project like ERD diagrams, data dictionaries, etc.
- **/config**: This folder holds all three settings files as well as the wsgi file that AWS looks for when deploying `/config/wsgi.py` and url configuration file `config/urls.py` for the entire project.


## :startapp subgenerator

When you run `yo django-2s:startapp` the resulting file structure should look like this. Note that this file structure will be located in a folder with the app name you give in the :startapp subgenerator prompt.

```bash
.
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
├── apps.py
├── helpers.py
├── management
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── commands
│       └── __init__.py
├── models.py
├── static
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── img
│   └── style.css
├── templates
│   └── index.html
├── tests.py
├── urls.py
└── views.py
```

These are the primary files you'll be working with since they largely control what's happening on the front-end and back-end of your application.

A quick rundown of the files:

- **admin.py**: Use this file to register models, so that users can interact with the database from Django's built-in admin interface. Additional docs on admin.py [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/).
- **apps.py**: This is where you should declare a name for your app plus any other application configuration. This is particularly helpful when writing Django's class-based views. Additional docs [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/applications/)
- **helpers.py**: A file to write additional functionality outside of Django's main files. For example if your app needed to use requests to hit an API for data, you'd write that function here.
- **models.py**: Where you declare information about the data your app will be processing. If your application is going to be using lots of models, it may be more logical for you to create a folder that organizes models into several different files. Examples of that structure [here](https://github.com/rji-futures-lab/django-rmp-data/tree/master/rmp/models). More information about how to write Django models and the fields that Django supports [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/models/).
- **tests.py**: Write tests for your code here. More information about writing tests in Django [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/overview/).
- **urls.py**: This is the url configuration file for **just your application**. Route the application's views in this file. More on Django's URL dispatcher [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/).
