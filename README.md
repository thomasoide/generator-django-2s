# Django Generator 2s

This is a Yeoman based project generator that generates barebones scaffolding for most Django apps I build.

## Install

1. Assuming you're using a Mac, install Homebrew and run `brew install node`. You'll need Node 8 or later.
2. Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/): `npm install -g yo`
3. Clone this repository (Since this is small scale, I figure it'd be easist to do this way): `git clone <CLONE URL>`
